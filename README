TPCB and TPCC for VoltDB and CVoltDB, for Voltdb v4
Note: tpcb was written by Betty, derived from tpcc provided with Voltdb distro
  CVoltDB tpcc was written by Weiwei, derived from VoltDB tpcc

for version 4, we have only pure Voltdb sources, no CVoltDB support

To run with VoltDB:
Copy everything to ../tpc-bc-v4

To run with a Voltdb server in dir at ../spot

To run server: single host
Single Host: uses deployment.xml
bash run_tpc[bc]1.sh spot catalog-v      for Voltdb server

bash run_tpc[bc]1.sh spot server > /mnt/ramdisk/server.log   (either server)
(or use runservers1.sh, which uses /mnt/ramdisk for output)

Multihost: uses mhx_deployment.xml x= 2, 3, or 4
--Check host ids in run_tpc[bc]x.sh
bash run_tpc[bc]x.sh spot catalog-v      for Voltdb server at ../spot
bash run_tpc[bc]x.sh spot server > /mnt/ramdisk/server.log   (either server)

The running of servers on multiple hosts is automated by the runserversx.sh series
They output to /mnt/ramdisk, the ramdisk created at bootup by fstab entry
bash runserversx.sh tpc[bc] spot catalog-v    for Voltdb server, K=0
  so for example for escrow tpcb using CVoltdb in apr6 on 4 hosts, K=0:
  logon to cv2, the assumed controlling host
  cd tpc-bc-v4  (copy of tpc-bc4 available on all 4 hosts)
  bash runservers4.sh tpcb apr6 catalog-v    will run server on 4 hosts
  Note: don't use " > output-file" with runserversx.sh
  for asserts: bash runservers4.sh tpcb apr6 catalog-v -ea

For K=1 replication, not available in v4 for community edition of VoltDB
bash runserversxk1.sh tpc[bc] spot catalog-cv|catalog-v [-ea]

Running clients: TPCB needs MP% argument, but TPCC does not

To run TPCB client with 15% MP:
Single host
bash run_tpcb1.sh spot client 15 > client.log    (space needed between 5 and >)
or, for enabled asserts
bash run_tpcb1.sh spot client-ea 15 > client.log 

Multiple (2 here) server hosts, client on one host:
bash run_tpcb2.sh spot client 15 > client.log   (space needed between 5 and >)
With replication:
bash run_tpcb2k1.sh spot client 15 > ...

TPC-C: run_tpcc1.sh for single host, like run_tpcb1.sh
--but no MP_PERCENT arg as yet
With replication:
bash run_tpcc2k1.sh spot client > ...
